summarizing the three test cases:
1.Temperature: ( 0.2, 0.7, 1.0) to control randomness
2.Max New Tokens/Max Length: ( 50, 150, 300) to control output length
3.Top-P (Nucleus Sampling): ( 0.5, 0.9, 1.0) to control token selection diversity
Analysis: Temperature: 0.2 its more stable, 0.7 is less stable, 1.0 is hallucinations, not consistant.
Max New Tokens/Max Length: (e.g., 50, 150, 300) to control output length.
Top-P (Nucleus Sampling): (e.g., 0.5, 0.9, 1.0) to control token selection diversity.
